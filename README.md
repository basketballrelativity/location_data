### Shot Charts

These shot charts are from a 1/21/19 contest between the 76ers and Rockets. The Rockets played to their strengths by shooting three-point and restricted area field goals almost exclusively. However, the 76ers blew out the Rockets, 121-93, in part due to their ability to get good looks at the rim.
